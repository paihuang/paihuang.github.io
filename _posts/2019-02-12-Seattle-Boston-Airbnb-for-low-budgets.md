Some travelers have a tight budget. Some others travel not to go sightseeing but to spend
time with family or friends. They do not need the weather to be gorgeous. They wan to 
travel with a low cost. We obtained some AirBnb lodging price data for Seattle and Boston 
via Udacity, an online learning platform and we explore the data to gain insights. If you
fit in the aforementioned traveling types, read on. We have a treat for you. We will tell
you, based on the analysis we perform, what are the best months to travel to these two 
cities and the type of properties that will save you money on lodging. 


# - If money is an issue, visit Seattle in May and September and visit Boston in August and late October.
Seattle is known for its rain and extended days of overcast. In summer, the weather clears up and travelers
flock to Seattle to get close to nature. The AirBnb lodging prices are the highest in summer months (Jun-Aug)
but if visit in May or September and are lucky, you may also experience great weather there. Similarly, in 
Autumn months, travelers flock to New England to see the fall foilage and to enjoy the New England seafood. 
Therefore, in Boston, AirBnb lodging prices are highest in September and October. Visiting in August and late
October/early November will on average, save $40 a night compared to the peak season and also have a chance to
see the early sign or late phase of the fall foliage.

# - Data that we have does not suggest that month is a good predictor for price. 
Based on the data we get, we try to build a predictive model for price on month, property 
type (condominium, villas, dorms etc) and other variables that we thought would be good
predictors for price. However, we do not find month to be good predictors when we aim to
predict prices of individual properties. The graph that was presented earlier was produced 
by aggregating all properties.
